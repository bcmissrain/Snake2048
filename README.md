Game Snake2048 for Windows Phone using XNA Framework

I've written this game 2 years ago using XNA for Windows Phone.

You can play it in:

Now as you know,Microsoft gives up this Framework.

You can run this project in VS2010 with WP7 SDK.

And Attention Please:

You need to put the "devenv.exe.config" and "VPDExpress.exe.config" into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE" before opening the solution file!
